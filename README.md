## problem

for younger learners it is not yet possible to read an analog clock. the analog clock (mostly) shows only the hour hands. if a young learner has not learned about multiplication by 5, it is difficult to read the minute hand.

## solution

create a clock such that the hour hand shrugs the hour numbers (1-12) and the minute hand shrugs the minute numbers (1-59).

this repo contains potential programmatic ways to make such a clock (hopefully in more than one programming language).
